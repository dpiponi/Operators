Some unpolished notes on abusing the differential operator $D=\frac{d}{dx}$ for both symbolic and numberic integration and differential equ>ation solving.
Starts with some methods we were taught at high school(!) for solving differential equations which appear not to be well known among studen>ts today.
Apologies for some inconsistencies in notation.
