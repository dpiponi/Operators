Some unpolished notes on abusing the differential operator $D=\frac{d}{dx}$ for both symbolic and numberic integration and differential equation solving.
Starts with some methods we were taught at high school(!) for solving differential equations which appear not to be well known among students today.
Apologies for some inconsistencies in notation.
